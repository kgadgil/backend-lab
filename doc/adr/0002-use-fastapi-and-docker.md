# 2. Use FastAPI and Docker

Date: 2025-07-26

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Building a simple notes app using FastAPI and Docker. Everyone is using this stack and I want to start learning.

## Decision

* Start a virtual environment
* Use FastAPI to implement two endpoints: POST and GET. 
* Dockerize the application for further use. Add Docker compose
* Use local file storage for the first iteration

## Consequences

* Basic app will be setup. 
* Local file storage will not be sufficient, add SQLLite in next iteration. 

What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced by the change that will need to be mitigated.
