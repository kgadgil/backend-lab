# 5. Add authentication

Date: 2025-07-26

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In order to learn to build real FastAPI systems, adding authentication.

## Decision

* User registration
* User Login
* JWT tokens
* continue with SQLAlchemy and SQLite in sync.

## Consequences

* This is a toy example. Will probably configure OAuth in the future. 
* May need to add async capabilities when we go into production
